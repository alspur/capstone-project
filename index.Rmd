# About this book {-}

This book is part of my Capstone Project for the [Strategic Data Project Fellowship](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/fellowship), which is part of the [Center for Education Policy Research at the Harvard Graduate School of Education](https://cepr.harvard.edu).

Right now, too many data analysts, particuarly those working in education agencies, work in isolation from other analysts in their organziations. I believe that these analysts can dramatically improve their productivity, quality, and capacity by adopting collaborative practices from the software development world. 

I've worked to get my team of analysts at the Kentucky Department of Education embrace the idea of "collaborative analysis development." After we adopted some collaborative practices from the software development world, we greatly improved the speed, quality, and volume of our analytic work. 

This book is intended to help other analysts, particuarly those in education, to collaborate more in order to deliver more and better analysis to help organizations better serve students.
