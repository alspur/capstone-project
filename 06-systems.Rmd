## Common analysis format

- Identify optimal workflows
- Create common analysis structure
- Develop analysis templates (.Rmd)

## Style guide

- Seprate from analysis templates, start to identify common procedures
- Create checklists
- If it works for airline pilots and surgons, it can work for analysis developers.

## Code review
