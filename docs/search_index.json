Now more than ever, the use of data is a critical component of strategic decision-making within organizations. As computing costs have dropped precipitously and the volume of raw data has grown exponentially, leaders in organizations are eager to leverage these trends to better inform their choices. The most significant barriers to a data-informed organization are no longer financial or technological. Instead, personnel and culture tend to be the largest obstacles for organizations looking to improve their use of data. Nowhere is this more true than in education. For years, educators and policy makers have been encouraged to embrace “data-driven decision-making,” but few education organizations have personnel that focus specifically on data analysis. Instead, it has become yet another skill we’ve asked educators to add to their already-overflowing professional responsibilities. Even in larger education organizations that are fortunate enough to have dedicated data analysts, such as state education agencies (SEA’s), cultural barriers often prevent them from operating as effectively as they could. Analysts are often program-specific staff working on their own. Collaboration among data analysts in SEA’s is frequently an exception, not the rule. 2.2 Why should we care about the culture of data analysis? Data analysis is difficult work. It requires an understanding of the field you’re studying, statistical knowledge, some programming ability, and most importantly, the ability to translate your results for non-analysts. At rstudio::conf() in January 2017, Hilary Parker gave a presentation that pinpoints some of the most critical challenges faced by data analysts. In her talk, she notes that “creating an analysis is a hard, error-ridden process that gets ‘yadda-yadda-ed’ away” because we’re reluctant to share our own workflows and/or limit another analyst’s “creativity.” These norms between analyst can not only limit their own professional growth, it inevitably leads to mistakes that go unnoticed because there’s only been one pair of eyes on a project. To address this problem, Parker recommends that we start to think about ourselves as “analysis developers” and borrow some concepts from programmers and engineers. Errors will happen. Parker notes that we can learn from operations engineers, particularly Sidney Dekker’s book, “Understanding Human Error.” The lesson of this book is to not blame a person for their errors and instead to look at the process they used. This helps to make the after-action review conversations less personal and more focused on solving the problem at hand. Reducing error is a big reason to care about developing a healthy, collaborative culture among “analysis developers,” but there are many other benefits to improving how these folks work. It can help improve the quality and depth of analysis as they start to learn from one another. A more collaborative environment can also improve the speed of analysis as analysis development moves from an ad-hoc approach to one that follows a more standardized routine. This will also help to improve institutional knowledge of the analysis development process, making it easier to integrate new staff and maintain stability after a personnel transition. Education agencies could develop more accurate, high-quality, and reproducible analyses, but it order to do so, they need to deliberately build a strong collaborative culture among their analysis developers.

["team-structure.html", "Chapter 3 Team structure 3.1 Your primary collaborator 3.2 E pluribus unum", " Chapter 3 Team structure 3.1 Your primary collaborator No man is an island, and analysis developers are no different. Even if you are working as the lone analysis developer in your agency, it doesn’t mean you can neglect the structures a team needs to be successful. As Hadley Wickham notes in his {Expressing yourself with R](https://youtu.be/1POb5fx_m3I?t=34m12s) talk: “Every project you work on is fundamentally collaborative. Even if you’re not working with any other person, you are always working with future you. And you really don’t want to be in a situation where future you has no idea what past you was thinking, because past you will not respond to any emails.” The rest of this book assumes that you have embraced this idea. No matter the size of your team, from 1 to n, it is critical that you think about, test, and improve the systems you use to collaborate with others. 3.2 E pluribus unum Teams of analysis developers don’t form on their own - it takes leadership to build, grow, and maintain. The work can be challenging, as many prospective team members may come from differnet backgrounds, use different software packages, or tackle analysis via ideosyncratic (at sometimes inscrutable) methods. Yet at the same time, the heterogenatiy of your team is also an asset. The differing perspectives and strengths of your team’s members will allow you to survey problems from different angles and help mitigate the danger of groupthink. The leader of a analysis development team needs to do more than run meetings and assign work. They may help provide support on implementing particualr methodologies, perform final code reviews, and approve analysis before it is shipped outside the team. But the most crticial job they have is to ensure a healthy team culture. Building a strong team culture is hard. It relies on mutual trust, humility, and honesty - virtues that aren’t always easy to embody. But it can be done. As you start to think intentionally about your team’s culture, this sequence is a helpful staring point: Understand what your team culture is like right now. Define what direction your culture needs to move. Identify the behaviors/routines your team will implement to get there. Implement the selected behaviors/routines. Repeat. This process is a variant of the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop a strategic decision-making processed developed bya a fighter pilot. While building a team of analysis developer’s isn’t quite as intesnse as a dogfight, this process of intentional observation, decision-making, and action is an extremely helpful way to start improving your team’s culture at any stage of development. Developing a strong team culture is not a goal - it’s a continual process. This variation of the OODA loop supports thougthful observation, adaptation, and action. If your team is just starting to meet and is very heterogeneous, you won’t be able to get everybody working on the same software and using the same processes overnight. It will require intentional, incremental, and iterative change over time. "],
["tools-of-the-trade.html", "Chapter 4 Tools of the trade 4.1 Data analysis software 4.2 Version control", " Chapter 4 Tools of the trade Before you start engaging in analysis development work within your agency, you’ll need to make sure you have the right tools to get the job done. There are two software tools every analyst should utilize: a scripting-based data analysis platform and a version control system. 4.1 Data analysis software The most commonly used data analysis software is Microsoft Excel. While nearly every analyst cuts their teeth crafting spreadsheets and pivot tables in this popular software, it’s not an ideal platform for professional analysis developers. Excel’s cell-based structure obscures the formulae that drive analysis work, making it hard for others (and often yourself) to understand what’s actually going on “under the hood.” Scripting-based data analysis languages are the cure for the common spreadsheet. They make the entire analysis process transparent by explicitly stating what actions will happen and the order in which they will be executed. I use and heartily recommend using R as your main platform for data analysis. It is free, open-source, and has a vibrant community of developers and practitioners working to improve the language. 4.2 Version control At some point, we’ve all worked on a project where we’ve saved multiple versions of a file. “Save as…” is a great tool for simple projects when you’re going from “v1” to “v2” to “final_draft,” but we can quickly push on the edges of this approach’s usefulness. If you want to go back to an earlier iteration of your work, it’s hard to know which version you’re looking for or what changed from “v3” to “v4.” If you’re working with multiple people, emailing documents back and forth, it’s amazing how quickly you can lose track of which “v3FINAL” document is the version you want to be looking at right now - is it the one Jane sent yesterday or is the one Johnny sent today? Version control systems help to alleviate these problems. Instead of requiring you to save multiple versions of one file, version control software allows you to have one file, but track all of the changes made since its inception. The most commonly used version control system is Git, which can be paired with the GitHub service to keep a copy of your documents and the changes you’ve made to them in the cloud.
